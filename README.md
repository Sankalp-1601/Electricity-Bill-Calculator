# Electricity bill calculator
The main aim of this project is to create a user friendly calculator for the customer to calculate their monthly electricity bill according to meter reading and the current electricity rate per units consumed. I have created this calculator using pythonwhich calculates the bill by a simple formula i.e unit consumed * rate.
